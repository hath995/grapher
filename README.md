=======
This project is a basic computer algebra system written in Javascript. I started work on it to implement numerical algorithms that I was learning. Most of the algorithms worked with polynomials and some matrices. Several methods lent themselves to implementing a graphical interface to work with. Then it occurred to me that I could build on both mathematics and software design to make an interesting project. The challenge of writing good, object-oriented, documented, tested, and useful code is what has been the secondary goal. 

I realize I am reinventing the wheel somewhat but I feel like it is a good practice of knowledge and skill. The realm of math software is dominated mostly by native applications. There are exceptions like Wolfram Alpha but it is limited for non-paying customers. Javascript isn't the best language for scientific computation for a couple of reason but I don't think that means these capabilities should not be present on the web. This is still a learning project for me in a variety of ways but I hope to end with a useful application.
